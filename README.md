# Words Manager | 单词管理器

Words Manager is a Flutter GUI application by Haokee. You can use this application to manage your English words or phrases easily. The application uses the Flutter UI to draw the UI, providing unmatched performance and a material-style design that delivers a stunning visual experience even when unprocessed.

The application is divided into three pages: the homepage, the new word page, and the favorite word page. On the homepage, you can check the English, Chinese and parts of speech of all the words added; On the New Word page, you can fill in the information of the new word, and check the appropriate part of speech to add to the homepage; Favorite words are all the words that have hearts on display, and you can perform basic operations on the words on the homepage, including deleting and dotting hearts. It's worth noting that the application doesn't provide a page to make changes to words that have already been added, which means that the added words must be error-free, otherwise they can only be deleted and re-added. This is to ensure that words are not maliciously tampered with.

All words are saved to the words_manager folder under the system documents folder, and a single word is stored in a file, and the file name is the English word (no suffix). The specific format can be obtained by yourself.

单词管理器是一个由好渴鹅使用 Flutter 编写的 GUI 应用。你可以使用这个应用轻松地管理你的英文单词和短语。应用使用 Flutter UI 绘制 UI，提供了无与伦比的性能，配合 Material 样式设计，即使未经过处理视觉体验仍然震撼。

程序分为了三个页面：主页、新建单词页面和喜欢的单词页面。在主页，你可以查阅加入的所有单词的英文、中文和词性；在新建单词页面，你可以填写新建的单词的信息，并勾选适合的词性以便添入主页；喜欢的单词则是展览了所有点了红心的单词，可以在主页对单词进行基本操作，包括删除和点红心。值得注意的是，应用没有提供对已经加入的单词进行修改的页面，这代表着加入的单词必须保证是无错误的，否则只能删除重新添加。这是为了确保不会被人恶意篡改单词。

所有的单词全部保存到系统文档文件夹下的 words_manager 文件夹，单个单词存放进一个文件中，文件名即单词英文（无后缀名）。具体格式可以自行操作得到。
